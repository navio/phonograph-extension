# Phonograph App

Phonograph is an Open Source browser extension that focuses on privacy and security. What you listen to and what you follow is only stored on your computer. There are no servers to hack, passwords to steal, or ads to follow. You are in control of what you want to listen to and who you want to connect with.

All the persistent storage is stored locally on your computer in the browser (not in the cloud). The audio content is only executed in the browser and is deleted after completition.
